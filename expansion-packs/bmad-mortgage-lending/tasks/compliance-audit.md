Conduct a comprehensive mortgage compliance audit across disclosures, data integrity, and regulatory requirements.

## Prerequisites

- Access to full loan file including disclosures and correspondence
- Current regulatory reference library
- Audit checklist aligned to investor and agency rules

## Execution Steps

1. **Define Scope**
   - Identify loan stage (pre-funding, post-close) and applicable regulations.
   - Gather any prior audit findings or known issues.
2. **Review Documentation**
   - Validate completeness, timing, and signatures of required disclosures.
   - Confirm change of circumstance documentation and re-disclosures where applicable.
3. **Test Data Integrity**
   - Compare LOS data fields to source documents for accuracy (HMDA, LE/CD, AUS).
   - Note discrepancies, missing data, or tolerance violations.
4. **Assess Process Controls**
   - Evaluate adherence to internal policies (communication logs, escalation evidence).
   - Confirm tasks and approvals performed by appropriate roles.
5. **Summarize Findings**
   - Document defects with severity, impacted regulation, and remediation plan.
   - Recommend corrective actions and responsible owners.
6. **Deliver Report**
   - Populate audit report template and share with stakeholders.
   - Log audit completion in compliance tracking system and monitor follow-up.

## Completion Criteria

- Audit checklist completed with evidence references.
- Report issued with actionable remediation steps.
- Issues logged in defect tracking system with owners/dates.

## Compliance Notes
